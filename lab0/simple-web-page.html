		<h1>My first web page
		</h1>
		<p>This page demonstrates some <i>very</i> basic HTML for use in the intro lab
		of <b>GEOG N80</b> at Berkeley Geography, as taught in Summer 2017.
		</p>
		<p>This page was written by Eve McGlynn,
		who arrived at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">Berkeley</a> in summer 2016.
		</p>
		<p>Eve just got back from Armenia, where she was studying an old earthquake. Here is a map of the shaking.

		<p>Mostly she wandered around neighborhoods like <a href=
		"https://www.google.com/maps/@40.8158397,43.8457435,3a,75y,217.63h,77.87t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-XBgxxak10q8%2FV_ienT_yPbI%2FAAAAAAAAX54%2FSuGUZqIzdWYqSEY1wlGJdcRYFBdoX_r1QCJkC!2e4!3e11!6s%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2F-XBgxxak10q8%2FV_ienT_yPbI%2FAAAAAAAAX54%2FSuGUZqIzdWYqSEY1wlGJdcRYFBdoX_r1QCJkC%2Fw203-h100-k-no-pi-2.9999962-ya218.5-ro0-fo100%2F!7i4608!8i2304">this one</a>, which looks worse than it is.
		<p>Sometimes she found cool stuff like this old fountain.</p>
