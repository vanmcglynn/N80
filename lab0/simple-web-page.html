		<h1>My first web page
		</h1>
		<p>This page demonstrates some <i>very</i> basic HTML for use in the intro lab
		of <b>GEOG 80</b> at Berkeley Geography, as taught in Autumn 2018.
		</p>
		<p><em>This page took 5 minutes to make, and by the end of Lab0 you should be able to make something that looks much better! Take a moment to analyze the code (HTML and CSS) used to make this simple page about one of the instructors.</em></p>
		<p>This page was written by Eve McGlynn,
		who arrived at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">Berkeley</a> in summer 2016.
		</p>
		<p>When she's not making sweet maps or delivering lectures for this course, Eve researches an earthquake that happened in a city called Gyumri. Here's a map of the area:

		<p>Sometimes "research" means wandering around neighborhoods like <a href=

		<p>Sometimes she finds cool stuff like this old fountain.</p>
